# DEPRECATED ðŸ˜¢
I have since moved to [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and itâ€™s way better tool for formatting. However, I'm keeping this project on Github for educational purposes and to remind myself that once upon a time Iâ€™ve done something good in the universe and tell it to my children and their children's children. ðŸ‘´
